# Work Day Scheduler- APIs

## Description

This application was developed as a simple daily calendar to help schedule your work day. You can enter any text for scheduled events for each hour of the workday from 9am-5pm. Once you click the "save" button, the text entered will be saved even after refreshing the page. The hours are color coordinated in a way that helps you keep track of daily tasks by color coding past, present, and future hours.

The application is made to be easy to use and interactive, with display adjustable to screen size. JavaScript, HTML and CSS best practices for file structure and naming conventions were followed. 

While developing this website, I learned about using JQuery in order to shorthand Javascript language. I also utilized the Day.js library and learned about the different tools it has to offer to manage time for websites.

## Usage

Once viewing the website, you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). You can view the Local Storage via "Applications" and into the "Local Storage" tab to view the information which was stored.
